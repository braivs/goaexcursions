							🔆 Excursion to Hampi is a great opportunity to experience the unique atmosphere of real India! You will see the majestic ruins, built in the 14th century, of the ancient city of Hampi, the capital of the once brilliant and powerful Vijayanagar Empire. The ruins of the ancient capital, belonging to the UNESCO World Heritage Sites, appear here as fantastic scenery, against the background of which the life of the real Indian heartland flows, little changed since those ancient times.
