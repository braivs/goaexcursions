							The only thing that can be said about India for sure is a country of contrasts. And Mumbai (formerly Bombay) - the economic capital of India - is perhaps the most striking example of a city of contrasts. Here, palaces stand next to the slums, and the most beautiful monuments of colonial architecture are adjacent to new buildings made of glass and concrete. This city can be loved and hated at the same time. And definitely worth seeing it!
