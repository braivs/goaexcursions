              🏰 The settlement is a house for 2 people. Each house stands apart, not one interferes with the other. All of them are connected by threads of paths. Each house has its own name. <br>
              🐒 In the morning there will be a twitter of birds and the clatter of monkeys on the roof. All from natural materials - wood, stone, fabrics ... <br>
              👩 For ladies - a circle of painting on the body with henna. In the evening, an event with a performance - dancing of an ancient tribe will be held on the central site with a bonfire and torches. <br>
              🏊 Infinity pool, morning walks, forest excursions, evening show programs, books, sunset, bar, independent walks around the hotel along stone-paved trails. You won’t be bored - the schedule is very tight. <br>
              🍛 Food - Buffet consisting of many national Indian dishes. <br>
              🏡 Each house (number) is hidden from prying eyes in the forest. In the room - balcony, bed, shower (hot water), fumigator, fan. Everything is perfectly clean and tidy.
